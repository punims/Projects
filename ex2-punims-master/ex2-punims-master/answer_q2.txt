Q2: 
What happens if the center of the guassian (in the space domain) will not be at the 0,0 of the image?
Why does it happen?

We get very weird results, the reason for this is probably because if the 0,0 is in the center we end
up altering low frequencies instead of the high ones and in so we dont get the wanted effect.
