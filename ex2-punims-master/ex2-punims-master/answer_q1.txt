Q1: in section 2 why did you get two different magnitude images?

due to our calculations being discrete when transforming from fourier and back we lose information
in the form of imaginary values which we ignore.
also as said in the lectures, both are different ways of approximating the derivative of an image and in so they 
are fundementally different.
